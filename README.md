## Installation

### Poetry

Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and manages (install/update) them for you.

#### Windows
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run the following command:
```sh
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -
```
Add Poetry to your PATH by adding the following line to your PowerShell profile (`$PROFILE`):
```sh
$Env:Path += ";$env:APPDATA\Python\Scripts"
```

#### macOS / Linux
Open Terminal and run the following command:
```sh
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```
Add Poetry to your PATH by adding the following line to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):
```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### FFmpeg

FFmpeg is a comprehensive multimedia framework for handling audio, video, and other multimedia files and streams.

#### Windows
1. Download FFmpeg from the official [FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
2. Extract the downloaded zip file.
3. Add the `bin` directory of FFmpeg to your system's PATH.

#### macOS
You can install FFmpeg using Homebrew:
```sh
brew install ffmpeg
```

#### Linux
On Ubuntu/Debian-based distributions:
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```
On Fedora-based distributions:
```sh
sudo dnf install ffmpeg
```

## Install Project Dependencies

Once Poetry is installed, navigate to your project directory and install the project dependencies by running:
```sh
poetry install
```

## Running the Jupyter Notebook

To run the `CineSense.ipynb` Jupyter notebook:

1. Start the Jupyter notebook server:
    ```sh
    poetry run jupyter notebook
    ```
1. In the opened Jupyter interface, navigate to and open `CineSense.ipynb`.

This will allow you to interact with the notebook and run the required services.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues with the installation or running of the notebook, ensure all environment variables are set correctly and the paths to Poetry and FFmpeg are included in your system's PATH.
- Refer to the official documentation of [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html) for more detailed instructions and troubleshooting tips.
