      " The opening shot is a little confusing and a little unreal. That sense of unreality is because nearly every shot in this video is being played back at the wrong speed. We filmed this section at 30 frames a second, but it's being played back at 24, 80% of normal speed. So it just seems a little bit off. Plus we're using rapid cuts with no continuity between them, different clothes, different locations, different everything. We've also got some cutaways in extreme slow motion, because it looks spectacular, and because it lets me do a moody stare into the distance without having to hold it for so long that it becomes awkward. It also lets us fit in some product placement. Some of the shots aren't slow motion though. This is being played back faster than real time, so that the dancers seem more synchronised and precise than they really are. I mean, don't get me wrong, they're good, but would the speed change their movements look superhuman? Also, there are dancers, because having attractive people move in attractive ways makes the video more appealing. We couldn't afford a wind machine for this shot, so we bought a leaf blower from a hardware store. We kept the receipt, so we can return it after we're done. The trouble with filming everything in the wrong frame rate is that my voice won't sound right, so the vocal track for this was pre-recorded in a studio, and I'm lip syncing it at the wrong speed. If my lips don't quite match up at some point, we'll just cut to another take, or to a completely random, slow-mo shot of an object being destroyed, and no one will care. Actually, this isn't the studio where we recorded the vocal track. I recorded this weeks ago, so we could plan everything, but we didn't film that session, so we had to go to this separate recording studio to fake that footage. This microphone isn't even plugged in. We're now about two dozen of the way through, so here's a middle eight from me, the featured artist, in an attempt to cross promote us. Our schedule didn't match up, so this was all filmed separately. Despite that, we're still trying to convince everyone that Tom and I met up, a great friend, and they're definitely in the same room. This is the part where we break up the video with a bit of diagetic audio, just so people can't rip the whole thing off YouTube. This isn't actually a party. It may look like we're having a spectacular time, as that's the image we want to project, but in reality, we are on our 15th take. Everyone would quite like to go home. This final section is important, though, because it resolves the question at the start, why am I falling into a swimming pool? Because ending the same way we started makes the audience think that there's a sensible, circular narrative that ties everything together, even if there isn't. You can't buy this on iTunes or stream it on Spotify. It's not a song.\n",

      " So I know that most people going to college or university are pretty concerned about what it's going to be like, so I want to make a guide to help you out. One of the first things you need to know is that they're pretty expensive, and you can't have the same attitudes you didn't high school because if you fail something, you just have to take it again at your own expense. So before you go, you need to ask yourself the question, are you really there to drink and meet girls, or are you there to get a degree, it will help direct your career for the rest of your life. And once you figure that out, then you can ask yourself, am I dedicated enough to commit my whole data this for the next four plus years, or am I going to set some time aside to get my degree? Personally, I really decided to take everything one step at a time, and the first thing you have to do is register for courses. And you might have heard that the schoolwork is going to be a lot harder than high school, and I think most of us have had thoughts like, what are I'm just not smart enough for this? And the truth is, if you could navigate their website, you're smart enough. Now, you might be wondering what's the best program to take, and truth be told, this is not really a best program. The most important thing is choosing something that will help you find a sustainable job that you'll enjoy. Now, you might be thinking, wait a minute, how do I try to get the job I'll enjoy if I don't know what I'll enjoy because I've never had the job. And that's a good question, and I'll avoid by suggesting you use the following rule of thumb. So when you're picking a program, imagine a slider that goes from fun to how much money you'll make. And that's the spectrum you're dealing with. So one thing that most people are really excited about is making new friends, and don't worry, you'll get over that pretty quickly. But if you're talking to someone, one thing I think is really important is to avoid certain trigger phrases when you're talking to people from different departments. As an example, don't talk about the job market with fine art students. Don't talk to a pre-med or med students about student loans or how long until they graduate. And never, ever tell an engineering student you had a lot of homework last night, even if you're another engineering student. If you're wondering what type of engineering has the most homework, it's the one they're taking. On a similar note, as for how much work you should expect to do, when I started classes they told everyone, you should be studying for two to three hours at home for each hour of lectures you attend. And I remember thinking, wow, no homework. Unfortunately, that eventually backfired when we had an in-class midterm, and I couldn't find the room. So, along with that loophole that doesn't work, there's some common myths I wanted to spell right away, so you don't have the wrong idea about college or university. You'll still be one of the smart kids, myth. People are a lot more mature. Myth. You'll have a lot more sex. True. I'll have a lot more sex. Myth. Now, completely unrelated, but something that can really have an effect on your experience is the male to female ratio in a program. As an example, looking at the stats from our local schools, computer science and software engineering is 90% male, while the health and nursing programs are 90% female. You might be thinking, oh no, I'm a guy taking computer science, but I still want to meet girls. What does that mean? Means you fucked up. I took one job, a program course, and now I get an erection every time I see a gender-neutral name on an attendant sheet. Now, of course, when people think of college, they think of college parties. And so, I'd always wondered what it'd be like to be invited to one. On a bit more serious note, one thing I think needs to be said is that a lot of students are a little bummed out that they're really good at something in high school, but now they're kind of middle of the pack. The truth is, you don't need to be the best at your discipline to do great things. As an example, I never showed a lot of potential in high school, but now I make YouTube videos in my room. What I mean to say is I think it's important to look for other avenues to really help you stand out to employers and help your career in general. Like once your skill is at a certain level, you don't become a famous artist by being better than everyone at art or music. You get there by being better at marketing. You don't become a chief engineer by being better than everyone at math. You get there by being better at communication and dealing with people. And ultimately, you try to have at least a little bit of diversity, because even if you're lucky enough to have the ability to become the best in the world at one thing, in 30 years it'll be even more difficult to cope when we all get replaced by robots.

      " Okay now, let's start with minerals, solid naturally Yucca, reeks, substances made from elements, singles, or combos of many inorganic means anal, comp from plants, or animals, always a fixed-can-bickle structure, examples of coastal gold. All right, now do it from minerals, let's talk about what a rock is, composed of many different compounds, structures not consistent. There are major types of rocks, in total there are three igneas, metamorphic and sedimentary. First off, it's igneas, one of all canoeuvres, blues, magma, and then it cools down hardens within the earth's class, going to the metamorphic, formed by massive heat or pressure, sometimes they've found by the fault lines where place push against each other. Sedimentary rocks, rocks sediment combining, like a river picking up to the positive pieces, comes to ragged eventually. Inge is comes from a volcano, metamorphic formed by pressure, all heaps, sedimentary small pieces from a river, over and over and over again. Inge is comes from a volcano, metamorphic formed by pressure, all heaps, sedimentary small pieces from a river, over and over again. Okay, so, over a million zippies, rocks, flaming, and a few different ways and transition to the three rockers, continue with cycle of chains, most rocks aren't igneas, volcano, magma hardened, wind and water, big rock into small pieces, two piles of sediments. This sediment builds up sedimentary rock, it becomes. The rock is covered up and ends up inside the earth's class, with heaps, and pressure rise it off goes through metamorphosis, becomes a metamorphic rock, then cycle starts One thing to know about this cycle is the order's not specific Rocks and chains to different types based on a different environment, yeah!
